Using the continuity equation, the method eliminates the high multiplicity of near-zero eigenvalues of the operator while leaving the operator nearly positive-definite. The impact of the modified eigenvalue distribution on the accelerated convergence is explained by visualizing residual vectors and residual polynomials.},

	Notes = {(1050) The displacement current ∂D/∂t is composed of the field-induced component ∂(εinf E)/∂t and charge-induced component ∂P/∂t. When the E-field is applied to the charge-induced component of the displacement current, the E-field actually accelerates charges and gives them kinetic and potential energies (the P- and V-related terms). A part of the kinetic energy can be lost by scattering (the Γ-related term). When the E-field is applied to the field-induced component of the displacement current, the power is used to change the field energy ½ εinf E².(1050) Equating Eq. (14) to Eq. (15) is fine, but what justifies that the first term of Eq. (21) is qe(t) and the the quantity within the brackets is ue(t)? Nothing, mathematically. The only justification is physical interpretation: it makes physical sense that the first term of Eq. (21) is the damping rate of electrons' kinetic energy by drag forces. It might have been better to express the field energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, and power dissipation as Eqs. (22), (23) directly from the Lorentz model using classical mechanics, and then to show that the results are consistent with Poynting's theorem using Eq. (21).},

See "Q-factor/Mathematica/Derivation for complex frequency.m".(183901) Here, ω\_p is a function of position, but it is zero inside dielectric. Therefore, if there is only one kind of metal in this system, (S3) reduces to (S4).(183903) (183901) This should be "right".(183902) The relations between E, P, and V, i.e., Equations (4) and (5), do not involve spatial derivatives. Therefore, we can easily relate the three fields in a manner independent of the spatial form of the field distribution. On the other hand, the relation between E and H involves spatial derivatives. Therefore the relation between the two depends strongly on the shape of the field distribution.},
